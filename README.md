**Packaging Workshop Report**

**Introduction**

The workshop primarily focused on the evolution of semiconductor
packaging, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced 3D
packaging. It provided valuable insights into assembly and manufacturing
processes, along with detailed explanations of testing methods and
performance validation. A key highlight of the workshop was the hands-on
experience through two ANSYS lab sessions, one focused on thermal
simulation of semiconductor packages, and the other on package design
and modeling from scratch. Design, wafer processing, packaging and
testing, and assembly are the key stages in the semiconductor industry.
This workshop primarily focused on the packaging and testing phases. The
report is structured into five subsections, each outlining the key
learnings I gained from the workshop.

Figure 1 shows the basic structure of semiconductor packages and
commonly use packaging types such as through-hole mounting and surface
mount packages. Chip scale packaging (CSP) can reduce the total area of
the packaging, which is very close to the die size.

The section summarized the advantages and disadvantages of each type of
packaging as follows,

a.  **Through-Hole Package**

> Through-hole packages are known for their low cost, ease of manual
> assembly, and durability. These characteristics make them suitable for
> basic and legacy applications. However, they come with limitations
> such as a larger physical size, low pin count, and incompatibility
> with modern automated assembly systems. Due to these constraints, they
> are commonly used in consumer electronics, industrial applications,
> and older system designs.

b.  **QFN (Quad Flat No-lead)**

> QFN packages are compact, lightweight, and offer good thermal
> performance, making them ideal for space-constrained applications.
> Despite their advantages, they present challenges in terms of testing
> accessibility and repairability. Additionally, they feature smaller
> I/O pins compared to QFP packages. QFNs are typically used in
> smartphones, tablets, automotive electronics, and telecommunication
> devices.

c.  **QFP (Quad Flat Package)**

> Quad Flat Packages provide a higher pin density and are easier to
> inspect and solder, which is beneficial in densely packed circuit
> designs. However, their exposed pins are susceptible to damage and can
> be difficult to repair if bent. These packages are widely used in
> microcontrollers, microprocessors, and application-specific integrated
> circuits (ASICs).

d.  **BGA (Ball Grid Array)**

> Ball Grid Array packages support a higher number of pins and deliver
> excellent electrical and thermal performance. On the downside, they
> are difficult to inspect and rework, have a limited shelf life, and
> tend to be more costly than QFN packages. BGAs are ideal for
> high-performance integrated circuits where thermal and signal
> integrity are critical.

e.  **WLCSP (Wafer-Level Chip Scale Package)**

> Wafer-Level Chip Scale Packages significantly reduce the overall
> package size while maintaining high electrical performance at a lower
> cost. However, they are limited in terms of I/O pin count and may
> suffer from reliability issues such as solder joint failures and
> package warpage. These packages are commonly used in smartphones,
> Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and wearable electronics.
>
> **f. 2.5D IC Package**
>
> 2.5D packaging technology offers a higher level of integration,
> improved performance, and better power efficiency. It connects
> multiple dies through an interposer or substrate in a planar
> configuration. Despite its performance benefits, one of its main
> drawbacks is the longer die-to-die connection path. This type of
> packaging is suited for data center chips, RF wireless modules, and
> aerospace or space-grade electronics.

g.  **3D IC Package (with RDL Layer)**

> 3D ICs with Redistribution Layer (RDL) offer higher I/O density and
> more efficient routing at a relatively lower cost. However, they can
> experience reliability issues related to the polymer RDL and generally
> have lower I/O density compared to 2.5D packages. These are used in
> high-performance computing segments where both performance and cost
> are balanced.

II. **From Wafer to Package: Assembly and Manufacturing Essentials**

> First described about the supply chain of semiconductor industry,
> which is as follows.
>
> The **semiconductor supply chain** begins with the **design house**,
> where IC (Integrated Circuit) design is carried out using EDA
> (Electronic Design Automation) tools and foundry PDKs (Process Design
> Kits). This stage involves developing the test program and generating
> the GDSII layout, which serves as the blueprint for chip fabrication.
>
> The next stage is **wafer fabrication**, where silicon wafers are
> processed using specialized equipment, gases, chemicals, and
> materials. This results in wafers populated with fabricated ICs, ready
> for packaging.
>
> Following fabrication is the **package assembly and test** stage.
> Here, individual ICs are packaged using substrates, tools, chemicals,
> and lids. Each package is tested to ensure functionality and
> reliability.
>
> In the **board assembly and test** phase, multiple packages are
> mounted onto a printed circuit board (PCB) using appropriate tools and
> materials. These assemblies are then tested as a unit to verify
> overall board performance.
>
> The final step is **product assembly and test**, where all components
> are integrated into the final product using various tools. The fully
> assembled and tested products such as smartphones or computers are now
> ready for distribution and use.

> **Figure 2.** Steps involved in wire bond packaging.

Figure 2 illustrates the various steps involved in the wire bond
packaging process. Wire bond packaging is one of the earliest and most
widely adopted methods in semiconductor packaging. The process includes
several key steps: die attach, curing, wire bonding, transfer molding,
laser marking, and singulation, as depicted in the figure.

**Figure 3**. Different stages of flip chip packaging

Figure 3 shows the different stages of flip chip packaging. The process
includes bump formation, flipping the chip, chip placement, solder
reflow, flux cleansing, underfill dispensing, underfill cure, molding,
marking, ball mounting on the substrate.

> **Figure 4.** Steps involved in the wafer level packaging.

**Figure 4.** shows the steps involved in the wafer level packaging
(WLP). The key step involved in the WLP is the formation of
redistribution layers (RDLs). Redistribution Layers (RDLs) play a
critical role in Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) by enabling the rerouting
of I/O pads from the densely packed bond pads on the die to a larger
area, making external connections feasible. This is essential for
creating fan-out structures, which allow for more I/O connections than
the die itself would typically support. RDLs improve signal integrity,
reduce electrical resistance, and support higher performance in
miniaturized devices. They are key enabler for advanced packaging
technologies such as fan-in WLP, fan-out WLP, and 2.5D/3D IC
integration, contributing significantly to device scaling, form factor
reduction, and cost efficiency.

IV. **Ensuring Package Reliability: Testing And Performance Validation**

This section focused on the critical processes involved in verifying the
reliability and performance of semiconductor packages. Reliability
testing is a key stage in the packaging lifecycle, ensuring that each
package meets both functional and environmental specifications before
deployment in end-use applications. The testing process comprises
several stages:

a.  **Assembly Open and Short Tests:**

These are the initial electrical tests performed to detect basic
assembly defects, such as open circuits (incomplete connections) or
short circuits (unintended connections). These tests help identify
issues introduced during wire bonding or substrate interconnections.

b.  **Burn-In Tests:**

Burn-in testing involves subjecting the semiconductor package to
elevated temperatures and voltages over an extended period. This is
designed to accelerate the aging process and expose latent defects that
could cause early-life failures in the field. One of the main goals of
burn-in testing is to gather data relevant to the \"bathtub curve,\"
which illustrates the failure rate of a product over
time---characterized by high initial failure (infant mortality), low
constant failure rate during normal use, and increased failure rate as
the product ages. Burn-in helps ensure that only stable and reliable
devices proceed to market, thereby enhancing long-term product quality.

c.  **Final Testing (Cold and Hot Testing):**

Final testing is conducted across a range of temperatures---typically at
both low (cold) and high (hot) extremes---to validate the functional,
parametric, and reliability specifications of the package. This includes
verifying timing, current leakage, and thermal behavior to ensure that
the device performs consistently under various environmental conditions.
High-temperature testing, in particular, is crucial for confirming that
the semiconductor package can operate within specified thermal limits
without degradation or failure.

Collectively, these validation steps are essential for guaranteeing the
robustness and longevity of semiconductor devices. They play a vital
role in maintaining quality standards and customer confidence in
high-performance, mission-critical electronic systems.
